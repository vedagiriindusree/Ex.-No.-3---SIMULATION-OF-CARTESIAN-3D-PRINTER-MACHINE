## Playing with Axes
###   1.	Move the x-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the x-axis assembly.
###   2.	Move the y-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
###   3.	Move the z-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

# Smooth Rod :
It is guide rail component made up of hardened-steel or chrome plated steel .it smoothness ensures precise and consistent movement which is needed to produce accurate and high quality models.

# Bearing :
Linear bearings are typically used in conjunction with smooth rods,they are used to reduce friction .linear motion and rotational motion-ball bearing

# Idler :
The idler pulley helps to guide the belt along its path, reducing the chances of the belt slipping or jumping teeth and causing print defects.

# Extruder:
Extruder is used to melting and extruding the filament onto the print bed.

# Motor:
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes

 # Y-axis assembly:

# Y-Axis Supporter :
The Y-axis supporter must be designed to withstand the forces generated during printing and maintain the printer's accuracy and stability. Horiz. & Vertical Threaded Rod : The horizontal threaded rod is typically used to hold the pulley that drives the movement of the print bed along the Y-axis.The vertical threaded rod is typically used to control the Z-axis movement of the print bed

# Smooth Rod :
The use of smooth rods in the printer's Y-axis mechanism helps to provide smooth and precise movement of the print bed

# Pulley :
pulley is often used in the Y-axis mechanism to transfer motion from the printer's stepper motor to the print bed.

# Motor :
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes

# Y-Axis Frame :
It is responsible for support and stability of y axis frame.and also z axis.

# Y-Axis Base :
The Y-axis base is responsible for providing stability and support to the entire printer's structure,including the Y-axis frame, the print bed, and the printed object.

 # Z-axis assembly:

# Z-Axis Rod :
The z-axis rod is responsible for supporting the weight of the print head and controlling its movement as it moves up and down during the printing process

# Z-Axis Top Cover :
The primary purpose of the z-axis top cover is to prevent dust and debris from settling on the z axis rod, which can cause damage to the rod and the bearings that guide it

# Motor :
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

# Frame :
rigid structure that holds all the other components of the printer.

# Y-Axis assembly :
The Y-axis is responsible for moving the print bed back and forth along the horizontal axis.

# Z-Axis Assembly :
The Z-axis is responsible for moving the print head up and down along the vertical axis.

# X-Axis Assembly :
The X-axis is responsible for moving the print head back and forth along the horizontal axis.

# SMPS :
convert ac to dc current.

# LCD :
LCD screen provides a user-friendly interface that allows the user to control the printer and monitor its progress during printing.

# Spool Holder :
It holds spool.

# Spool :
a spool refers to a roll of filament that is used as the printing material for the 3D printer.
